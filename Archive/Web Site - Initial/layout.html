<h1> Godliness Introduction </h1>
<p>
Although we’ve all heard the word, few of us can give a quick and easy definition for godliness. We read little about it (historically the concept has been treated rather lightly in Christian literature), and we might conclude that it’s something we'll experience and understand only as we go much further down the road of Christian living.
But in the following excerpt from his new Nav Press book The Practice of Godliness, Jerry Bridges helps us to see the importance of this foundational spiritual attribute, and to commit ourselves to building it into our lives now.
</p>

<h1> Godliness More Infor </h1>
<p>
NO higher compliment can be paid to a Christian than to call him a godly person. He might be a conscientious parent, a zealous church worker, a dynamic spokesman for Christ, or a talented Christian leader; but none of these things matters if, at the same time, he is not a godly person.
The words godly and godliness actually appear only a few times in the New Testament; yet the entire Bible is a book on godliness. And when those words do appear they are pregnant with meaning and instruction for us.
